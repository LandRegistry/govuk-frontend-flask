      regulations’). If you’re not happy with how we respond to your complaint, <a class="govuk-link"

    <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">Technical information about this website’s accessibility</h2>

    <p class="govuk-body">{{config['DEPARTMENT_NAME']}} is committed to making its website accessible, in accordance with the
      Public Sector Bodies (Websites and Mobile Applications) (No. 2) Accessibility Regulations 2018.</p>
    
    <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Compliance status</h3>

    <p class="govuk-body">This website is fully compliant with the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/" class="govuk-link">Web Content Accessibility Guidelines version 2.1</a> AA
      standard.</p>
    <p class="govuk-body">This website is partially compliant with the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/" class="govuk-link">Web Content Accessibility Guidelines version 2.1</a>
      AA standard, due to [insert one of the following: ‘the non-compliances’, ‘the exemptions’ or ‘the non-compliances
      and exemptions’] listed below.</p>
    <p class="govuk-body">This website is not compliant with the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/" class="govuk-link">Web Content Accessibility Guidelines version 2.1</a> AA
      standard. The [insert one of the following: ‘non-compliances’, ‘exemptions’ or ‘non-compliances and exemptions’]
      are listed below.</p>

    <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">Non-accessible content</h2>

    <p class="govuk-body">The content listed below is non-accessible for the following reasons.</p>

    <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Non-compliance with the accessibility regulations</h3>

    <p class="govuk-body">Some images do not have a text alternative, so people using a screen reader cannot access the
      information. This fails WCAG 2.1 success criterion 1.1.1 (non-text content).</p>

    <p class="govuk-body">We plan to add text alternatives for all images by September 2020. When we publish new content
      we’ll make sure our use of images meets accessibility standards.</p>
    
    <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Disproportionate burden</h3>

    <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Navigation and accessing information</h3>

    <p class="govuk-body">There’s no way to skip the repeated content in the page header (for example, a ‘skip to main
      content’ option).</p>

    <p class="govuk-body">It’s not always possible to change the device orientation from horizontal to vertical without
      making it more difficult to view the content.</p>

    <p class="govuk-body">It’s not possible for users to change text size without some of the content overlapping.</p>
    
    <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Interactive tools and transactions</h3>

    <p class="govuk-body">Some of our interactive forms are difficult to navigate using a keyboard. For example, because
      some form controls are missing a ‘label’ tag.</p>

    <p class="govuk-body">Our forms are built and hosted through third party software and ‘skinned’ to look like our
      website.</p>

    <p class="govuk-body">We’ve assessed the cost of fixing the issues with navigation and accessing information, and
      with interactive tools and transactions. We believe that doing so now would be a <a href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2018/952/regulation/7/made" class="govuk-link">disproportionate burden</a> within
      the meaning of the accessibility regulations. We will make another assessment when the supplier contract is up for
      renewal, likely to be in [rough timing].</p>

    <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Content that’s not within the scope of the accessibility regulations</h3>

    <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">PDFs and other documents</h3>

    <p class="govuk-body">Some of our PDFs and Word documents are essential to providing our services. For example, we
      have PDFs with information on how users can access our services, and forms published as Word documents. By
      September 2020, we plan to either fix these or replace them with accessible HTML pages.</p>

    <p class="govuk-body">The accessibility regulations <a href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2018/952/regulation/4/made" class="govuk-link">do not require us to fix PDFs or other documents published
      before 23 September 2018</a> if they’re not essential to providing our services. For example, we do not plan to fix
      [example of non-essential document].</p>

    <p class="govuk-body">Any new PDFs or Word documents we publish will meet accessibility standards.</p>
    
    <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Live video</h3>

    <p class="govuk-body">We do not plan to add captions to live video streams because live video is <a href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2018/952/regulation/4/made" class="govuk-link">exempt from meeting
      the accessibility regulations</a>.</p>

    <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">What we’re doing to improve accessibility</h2>

      accessibility on this website.</p>
